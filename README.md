This is a secure file sharing service that allows users to exchange text, images, and files in an encrypted form, ensuring complete confidentiality.  
The service accepts text as input, encrypts it using RSA and AES encryption algorithms, and generates a unique link that can be shared with another person. Upon opening the link, the recipient will be able to access the decrypted content, while the service will automatically delete all encrypted data related to that content.

## Features

- **Encryption:** All content exchanged through this service is encrypted using robust encryption algorithms.
- **Text Exchange:** Users can exchange text messages securely.

## How It Works

1. The user enters text into the service.
2. The service encrypts the content using a secure encryption algorithm.
3. A unique link is generated, which can be shared with the intended recipient.
4. The recipient opens the link and is able to access the decrypted content.
5. After the content has been accessed, the service deletes all encrypted data related to that content, leaving no trace behind.
